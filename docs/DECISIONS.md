# Experiment decisions

1. All old tables, plots, and validation CSVs are historical drafting material,
   not formal evidence, because their raw logs, code, and provenance are absent.
2. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8 GB (`pi4b8g`) is the primary evaluation device.
3. The Pi 3B+, Pi 4B 4 GB, and Pi 5 are optional sequential portability checks;
   they are not required to run simultaneously with the primary device.
4. One external logging power meter is sufficient because devices are measured
   sequentially. Internal Pi telemetry is diagnostic, not a replacement for
   input-power measurement.
5. The M4 Mac mini is used for data preparation, model training, orchestration,
   aggregation, and plotting. It is not the claimed lightweight deployment target.
6. Pi 5 is excluded from the present stage while HORIZON00 is running.
7. Smoke results are always marked `paper_eligible=false`.
